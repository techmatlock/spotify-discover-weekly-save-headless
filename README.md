## Prerequisites
* Python <= 3.10.12 
* pip <= 22.3.1
* spotipy <= 2.23.0

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/techmatlock/spotify-discover-weekly-save-headless.git
```
2. On your local machine in the project directory, initialize your virtual environment. ```python -m venv venv```
3. Install the required packages: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. Go to your Spotify Developer API dashboard - https://developer.spotify.com
5. Create a new app, go to Settings, and save the CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, and REDIRECT_URI.

6. Export your environment variables.
```
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-secret-here
export SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080
export USERNAME=your-username-id
```
7. Go to your Spotify account and add a new playlist called "Discover Weekly Exports.
8. You only have to do this ONCE.  If you don't have a ".cache*" file already in your project directory, you must first generate one. (This is a feature missing from Spotify OAuth and must generate token on machine with a browser.)
Add the Python code below after line 30 in ```main.py```
```
sp_oauth.get_access_token()
```
9. Go to your server, clone this repository and copy the newly-created ".cache*" file on your local machine to the server where you'll be running this script in headless mode.
10. On your server, run the script: ```python3 main.py```

## Challenges/Obstacles Encountered
* I ran into an issue where I needed to get an access token to authenticate with via OAuth, but the Spotify API doesn't have support to get an OAuth token on a headless system.  You have to run the code with ```sp_oauth.get_access_token()``` which will generate an .cache-username file in your project directory.  Once you have that file, you can specify the cache file in the cache_path parameter ```sp_oauth = SpotifyOAuth(client_id=SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID, client_secret=SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET, redirect_uri=SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI, username=USERNAME, scope=SCOPE, cache_path=CACHE_PATH)```.  We also call the refresh_token method to re-use that same .cache* file we generated earlier to use the same token after it expires every 60 minutes.

## Errors
This error means the song's already exist in the exported playlist and can be ignored:
```
HTTP Error for POST to https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/7KJ6tM0pCMw6uAifySojjo/tracks with Params: {'position': None} returned 400 due to Error parsing JSON.
An error occurred: http status: 400, code:-1 - https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/7KJ6tM0pCMw6uAifySojjo/tracks:
